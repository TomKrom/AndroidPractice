This repository contains 6 weeks of content that focuses on introducing concepts in plain Java and relates them to how Java is used in Android Studio afterwards as well. Often students starting to create apps. Students may have some degree of experience with OOP but are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options and different terminology present in the Android API. The contents of this repository aim to (at least partly) resolve that and help students gain a better understanding of using Java for the Android platform.

Each week starts with an introduction of one or more concepts, which are accompanied  by small exercises and sometimes demos using [CS50's lab](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/lab/) format. These concepts are then related to the Android API in a second part, using a lot of examples and explaining how the functionalities are similar to those that can be found in more simple Java programs.
