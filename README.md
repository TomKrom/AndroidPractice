# Android Practice

A set of guides and exercises made for the Native App Studio course (@uva/app-studio) of @minprog. This repository contains 6 weeks of content that focuses on introducing concepts in plain Java and relates them to how Java is  used in Android Studio. Often students starting to create apps. Students may have some degree of experience with OOP but are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options and different terminology present in the Android API. The contents of this repository aim to (at least partly) resolve that and help students gain a better understanding of using Java for the Android platform.

Each week starts with an introduction of one or more concepts, which are accompanied  by small exercises and sometimes demos. These concepts are then related to the Android API, using a lot of examples and explaining how the functionalities are similar to those that can be found in more simple Java programs.
