# Working with Android Studio
Android Studio can be an overwhelming environment at first. In this section we show you some small tips and tricks to help you better navigate it and set it to your preferences.


## Look and feel
You can change the theme of Android Studio from dark to light through `File > Settings > Appearance and Behaviour > Appearance`. If you are colorblind, a mode to help you better discern between colors in the editor also exists here. 

This menu also allows you to change the font size, if you wish to do so. On smaller but low res monitors you might want a smaller size to allow for more code on the screen, or you might to set the font bigger to avoid eye strain and keep it easily readable.

Not all distributions of Android Studio show line numbers by default. To show them, right click in the margin of a  file and enable them from there.

## Shortcuts
There are quite a few shortcuts that are practical when working with Android Studio (or just in general).

- Double click inside a word to select this word.
- Triple click to select the full line.
- CTRL+D to duplicate a line.
- Shift+Alt on a selection and arrow keys to move this selection up or down at once.
- CTRL+F to find and CTRL+R to find and replace.
- While having a variable, method or class selected, shift and two times F6 to open the refactoring/renaming dialog.
