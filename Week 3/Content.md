# Java Basics for Android
This week, we will focus on an important part of Android: the adapter. Android's `Adapter` class helps you translate lists of data to layout objects on the screen. To help you understand how it works, we will first take a look at different kinds of arrays and lists in Java and then provide a very barebones example of what an adapter does in plain Java. Finally, we will use this knowledge to use Android's actual `Adapter` class effectively.

### Arrays and lists

While programming applications, you often have to represent lists of data. In Java, there are different ways to do this. We will discuss the array and the list. A regular array can be used to store a fixed number of elements. This means that upon declaring it, you must specify the amount of elements:

        int[] intArray = new int[10];
        String[] stringArray = new String[10]

The line of code above creates an array that has space for 10 integers and another array that has space for 10 strings. Because the array's size cannot be changed, we would have to reinitialize the array if we wanted to have 11 elements, for example. 

To solve this problem and also allow for easier modification of the array's contents (adding/removing/sorting elements for example) the `ArrayList` exists. It functions as a dynamically re-sizing array. It allows you to add or remove elements at specific indices or just the end. 

For most operations using lists of data that require you to have a dynamically resizable list, `ArrayList` is the way to go. Its main strength is that it is fast to read data at specific indices. To initialize an `ArrayList` you can use the following syntax:

        ArrayList<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<String>();
        ArrayList<String> stringList = new ArrayList<String>(20);

The type between the `<>` tells the compiler what the type of the elements you want to store in the list is. This can be a type such as `String`, but also a custom object such as `Student`. If practical, you can also specify the initial size of your `ArrayList`. However since it can be dynamically resized, you are free to add extra elements at any point!



> While you can declare regular arrays with primitive types such as `int` and `boolean`, the `List` interface requires you to use their respective wrapper classes `Integer` and `Boolean`. All primitive types have such a wrapper class, should you need it.

The class contains many functionalities. Below is a list of ones you will use a lot, but it is by no means exhaustive! Refer to [the documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/ArrayList) for a full overview of the available methods. 

- `add()`
- `size()`
- `clear()`
- `contains()`
