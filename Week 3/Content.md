# Java Basics for Android
This week, we will focus on an important part of Android: the adapter. Android's `Adapter` class helps you translate lists of data to layout objects on the screen. To help you understand how it works, we will first take a look at different kinds of arrays and lists in Java and then provide a very barebones example of what an adapter does in plain Java. Finally, we will use this knowledge to use Android's actual `Adapter` class effectively.
